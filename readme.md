## Overview
The Paris RealEstate Scraper is a python-based web scraping tool designed to extract real estate data from French real estate websites and store them in a MySQL database for later use.

As I'm new to web scraping I'll be starting with the website *bienici* and branching to other websites later on. 

Maybe somewhere down the track I'll build a website so anyone can interact with the data.
